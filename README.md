The Movie Database (TMDb) is a community built movie and TV database. Their database contains a lot of movies, tv shows, artists and many more. They also provide developers access to their database for FREE! Using their API is a great way to get started with networking in Android. Let’s first know the details of the app that we’re going to make.

The main third-party libraries that we’re going to use in Movieflex project are:

**Retrofit** (Handles our network related features)
**Gson** (For Parsing JSON objects from TMDb API)
**Glide** (Image Loading Library)
